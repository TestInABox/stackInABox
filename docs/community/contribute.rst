Pull Requests
-------------

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure to:

* Update existing tests as necessary
* Add new tests for any new functionality
* All tests pass
* PEP 8 compliance

**Additional Style Rules**

* Docstrings are required for classes, attributes, methods, and functions
* Format non-trivial commands using some appropriate prefixes. Here's some examples::

	# Enhancement: Added new functionality
	# Bug Fix: Corrected bug
	# Refactor: changed around code

* Use whitespace to separate blocks to improve readability
* Do not use single character variables except for well-known cases as part of loops or formulas.
* Do not try to be complex or clever; but if you must heavily document it and why
* When in doubt, go for readability
