Breaking Changes
----------------

Fixed
-----

- Attempted fix of ```httpretty``` usage for Travis-CI

  .. note:: ```httpretty``` is having issues with Travis-CI and Python3 but
     does work.

  .. note:: We are still using ```httpretty``` 0.8.6 as it does work with
     Python3; 0.8.8 is supposed to have one fix, but causes other parts of the
     tox run to hang. 0.8.9 also causes tox to hang.

- Added missing dependencies (```six``` and ```mock```).
- Removed documentation related to the OpenStack API that is now in its own
  project
- Return 405 if URI is handled but the requested HTTP Verb (aka method) is not
  available
