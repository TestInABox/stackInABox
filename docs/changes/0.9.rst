Breaking Changes
----------------

Fixed
-----

- Attempted fix of ```httpretty``` usage for Travis-CI
  - Note: ```httpretty``` is having issues with Travis-CI and Python3 but does work.
  - Note: We are still using ```httpretty``` 0.8.6 as it does work with Python3; 0.8.8 is supposed to have one fix, but causes other parts of the tox run to hang. 0.8.9 also causes tox to hang.
- Added missing dependencies (```six``` and ```mock```).
- Removed documentation related to the OpenStack API that is now in its own project
- Return 405 if URI is handled but the requested HTTP Verb (aka method) is not available
