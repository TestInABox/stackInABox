ChangeLog for Stack-In-A-Box 0.8
================================

New
---
- StackInABoxService is not fully unit tested
- Adds support for the user to specify regex patterns for the end-point registration
  - regex patterns must start with ```^``` and end with ```$``` and operate on the whole URI service path (e.g /v1.0) for the service
- OpensStack API mocks are no longer part of Stack-In-A-Box	
  - OpenStack API is now its own separate project:  https://github.com/BenjamenMeyer/openstackinabox
